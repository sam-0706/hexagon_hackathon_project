    <h3 class="man"><div>Introduction:
        The energy industry is a critical component of a country's economic growth and sustainability. With the increasing demand for energy and the depletion of non-renewable resources, there is a need for accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply to optimize energy generation, storage, and distribution. This project aims to develop an AI/ML-based forecasting model that accurately predicts energy demand and supply in short-term and long-term periods.
        </div>

        <div>Motivation:
            The lack of accurate energy demand and supply forecasting has resulted in power outages, energy waste, and inefficient use of resources. This project aims to address these issues by providing reliable and timely information about energy demand and supply. This information can help energy planners and grid operators to optimize energy generation and storage, reduce reliance on non-renewable resources, and improve overall energy efficiency.
            </div>
        
        <div>Problem Statement:
            The challenge is to develop an AI/ML-based forecasting model that accurately predicts energy demand and supply in short-term and long-term periods. This model should take into account various factors that affect energy demand and supply, such as weather data, grid data, consumer data, and historical energy production and consumption data.
            </div>
        <div>Existing Work:
            Various models have been developed in the past to forecast energy demand and supply, such as time series models, regression models, and neural network models. However, these models have limitations in terms of accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency.
            </div>
        <div>
            Literature Survey:
        Recent research has focused on the development of AI/ML-based forecasting models that can handle large datasets, improve accuracy, and reduce computational costs. These models include deep learning models, ensemble models, and hybrid models that combine multiple techniques to improve forecasting accuracy.
        
        </div>
        <div>Explanation:
            The proposed solution involves collecting data from various sources such as energy production data, energy consumption data, weather data, and consumer behavior data. This data will be preprocessed, cleaned, and scaled to ensure accuracy and consistency. Feature engineering techniques will be applied to identify relevant features that affect energy demand and supply and engineer new features that may improve the accuracy of the forecasting model.
            
        The model will be trained using machine learning techniques such as regression, clustering, and deep learning. The trained model will be deployed into a production environment, where it can generate real-time forecasts of energy demand and supply. The model will be monitored and maintained over time to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
        </div>
        <div>Proposed Solution:
            The proposed solution is an AI/ML-based forecasting model that accurately predicts energy demand and supply in short-term and long-term periods. This model uses historical data on energy demand and supply, as well as other relevant data sources such as weather data, grid data, and consumer data, to generate accurate predictions of energy demand and supply. The unique selling proposition of this solution is its ability to provide reliable and timely information about energy demand and supply, enabling energy planners and grid operators to make informed decisions about energy generation, storage, and distribution.
            </div>
        <div>Conclusion:
            The proposed solution for the demand and supply forecasting problem is an AI/ML-based forecasting model that uses historical data on energy demand and supply, as well as other relevant data sources such as weather data, grid data, and consumer data, to generate accurate predictions of energy demand and supply in short-term and long-term periods. This solution promotes sustainability by enabling energy planners and grid operators to better manage energy resources, optimize energy generation and storage, and reduce reliance on non-renewable resources. By providing reliable and timely information about energy demand and supply, our solution can help to prevent power outages, reduce energy waste, and improve overall energy efficiency.</h3>
